####### Substituting string and repeated command ######


--------- Random text 

hello john 

john says nothing 


what john is doing 

is john is dancing? 
is john is playing?
is john is moving?
is charcter is studying?

who is that john?




as we see here john is repeating

replacing all the character with john
by use of command 
:%s/<word you want to substitute>/<what you want to place of that word>/g  


it relace in whole file because of %

if we want that replace only in selected portion then we use :s not use %



----------------------------

---> using same command somewhere in file then use '.' called period character to which use help to run the previous command again 



***** MACROS AND REGISTER IN VIM *****

whenever we copy or delete something then it is save in the registers 



whenever we delete something then we paste same word which is deleted so deleting in file is copying 


"7yy:reg copying to line 7 in register



just random typing

d3wA 100 delete 3 word and at end of line add 100

now everything is recorded by using the command'qa' in register for quit recording type q

run recorded register by @a

now everything is recorded

now everything is recorded
